 This program is meant for Ethical Hackers and pentesters, it is a script I wrote that automates the WiFi password cracking process in Linux/Unix operating systems. Kali Linux Distribution is recommended for this. [Kali Linux Downloads] (https://kali.org/downloads) Website.
# ATTENTION: This program is meant as educational resource, and for use of pentesters who are allowed to test networks, or network owners who wish to test their own. Hacking/Cracking WiFi networks without authorization, is illegal, no matter what your intentions are, if you do not have permission, it is illegal, and I am not held responsible.
